# Introduction

Communication is an important aspect of any workplace, therefore understanding the differences in which males and females communicate can greatly benefit a work environment.  Generally, there are common strengths and weaknesses that each gender has within their communication style.  For example, women usually posses strengths in active listening skills and displaying empathy, but being overly emotional or not being authoritative are considered weaknesses in their communication (Goman).  On the other hand, men usually posses strengths in being direct and effectively displaying power, but their weaknesses include being insensitive or overly blunt (Goman).  These examples of characteristics within communication show how males and females differ when it comes to their usual communication style.  Therefore, it is important to be aware of these differences within workplace communication so that the work environment can be a safe and inclusive place for everyone. 

The issue that we will be discussing throughout this resource is the differences in communication that occur in business settings due to gender and how this can cause individuals to be treated differently.  There is evidence that shows how communication issues have contributed to the barriers that women face within the workplace (Barrett & Davidson, 2006, p. 2).  Historically, women were not present within business settings as their main job was to work at home which included duties such as cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the children.  Women began to  join the workforce and the amount of working women continues to increase annually.  Women now occupy about 48% of the entire private sector workforce (Bocconi, 2021).  Although, on average women are still paid less than men for doing the same job, but that is another issue.  This means that women are now just as present in many workplaces as men are, therefore it is important to understand each gender's communication styles so that workplace conversations can be respectful and beneficial.  

The World Economic Forumâ€™s Global Gap Report in 2020 found that there is a 31.4% average gender gap that remains to be closed globally (Bocconi, 2021).  This may be showing how there is a gender bias when it comes to workplaces, in regards to hiring and positions.  People perceive that males are more equipped for leadership roles, while women are more effective in subordinate roles (Barrett & Davidson, 2006, p. 10).  This has been a widespread belief, as women are not seen as leaders in many cultures, whereas men are because of their perceived power and directness when communicating.  When it comes to leadership positions in the workplace, women are only occupying 29% of senior-level executive positions (Bocconi, 2021).  This all ties into the communication styles that women have which are different to those of men.  Communication can play a role in gender biases within the workplace, which is why we have made the choice to discuss this important issue.
