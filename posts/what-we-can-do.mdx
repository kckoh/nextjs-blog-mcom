## 1. **Educating a team about gender and gender bias** 

Gender and gender bias are always major issues in our society. Also, communication between the different genders in the workplace remains unsolved. For that reason, educating a team bout gender and gender bias is highly recommended. An advantage of this method is given by Gratis, “When people become aware of their own biases and areas of ignorance, it creates the possibility for positive change. When given information that shows how they have treated another person unfairly, most people will correct their behaviour” (Gratis, 2022). Some people unintentionally tend to show gender discrimination while communicating with other employees while some people show aggressive behavior when communicating with co-workers because they believe that their gender is superior to others. To reduce these conflicts, all employees should receive regular education about gender and gender bias. The workplace is not only a place to show one's abilities but also a place where one has to make successful results by harmonizing with others. If they are educated, they will realize the wrong perceptions and behaviors about gender and will be more respectful toward different gender while communicating. 

## 2. **Making an HR team** 

Gratis also states the importance of creating an HR team, “If an issue arises, ensure the company has an HR representative who is informed and equipped to deal with these matters in a respectful, tactful, and fair manner” (Gratis, 2022). Having an HR team allows the company becomes more systematic. When employees have communication difficulties because of their gender, HR should find an appropriate solution. HR should also continue to encourage their employees to ensure there is no gender discrimination among them. The working environment needs to be improved by constantly monitoring the working conditions and difficulties of employees.

## 3. **Dealing with the language between men and women.** 

Wortland explains the attitudes of men and women toward language, “men use language as a problem-solving tool while women use it to create connections and share validation” (Wortland, 2022). Men and women use language differently. Using the strength of problem-solving by men and the power of making connections by women in a conversation can reduce conflict. Awareness of different language styles helps employees to respect different communication styles. 

## 4. **Encouraging diversity** 

According to Hofstede research, countries of North America such as Canada, United States, Jamaica, and Mexico have higher masculinity level which means these countries have more than 50% masculinity (Hopstede Insights, 2021). Organizaiton should encourage diversity. Gratis is explaining what attitude the company should have, “Include people of different genders, races, and backgrounds so that company can make decisions in light of how they affect everyone at your company and not just one group or gender” (Gratis, 2022). Workforce diversity is very common phenomenon in the organization. As Gratis mention, diversity in the organization can be a major factor of making an important decision. In countries with a high percentage of male images, such as the countries mentioned above, male employees' opinions may be given more weight when making important decisions in the company. However, organizations need to create an workplace where male and female employees can express their opinions equally. Therefore, Moreover, female and male employees should communicate with each other effectively and make important decisions together.

## 5. **Creating gender-neutral policies.**

Creating policies are essential in the organization. Gratis also highlights the importance of creating gender policies, “Whenever possible, avoid creating policies that single out a specific gender” (Gratis, 2022). As she mentions that the company should make policies on gender, but the policies should not favor only one gender, but should make a policy that protects all genders. Under the gender-neutral polices, employees will behave differently and be more cautious when talking to each other. These policies should be realistic or practical by embracing the opinions of employees.

## 6. **Getting rid of stereotypes** 

Lastly, Gratis warns having stereotypes in communication and she also give a suggestion how the organization react to communication in workplace, “understanding is key to creating a work environment that fosters open communication and acceptance amongst all employees” (2022). There is no difference between men and women when it comes to how they communicate; instead, employees should consider that each individual has their own style regardless of gender.
