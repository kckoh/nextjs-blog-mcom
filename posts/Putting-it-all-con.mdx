Christian perspectives on gender communication vary depending on the specific denomination and individual beliefs within that denomination. In general, many Christians believe that men and women have different **strengths and roles** within the church and family. 

in Ephesians 5:22-23, it says, 


> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife 
> as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.


This verse suggests that men are intended to play a leadership role within the family, while women are to support and submit to their husbands.This belief can influence the way that men and women communicate within the church, family even the workspace, with men taking a more dominant role in decision making and leadership, and women providing emotional support and encouragement. However, gender roles in a business setting are blurry and christians should be cautious of stereotypical gender roles and willing to be flexible in the workplace

When it comes to communication, Christians should communicate with others in a way that is respectful, compassionate, and understanding. This means listening carefully to what others have to say, being open to different perspectives, and expressing their own thoughts and beliefs in a way that is clear and non-judgmental. Christians should also strive to communicate with others in a way that reflects the love and compassion of Jesus Christ. 

This means treating others with kindness and empathy, and being willing to offer support and help to those in need. Overall, the goal of Christian communication should be to build relationships and foster understanding and mutual respect between people.

1 Corinthians 13:4-8 says,

> Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
> It does not dishonor others, it is not self -seeking, it is not easily angered, 
> it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.


This verse emphasizes the importance of love in communication, and the need for people to communicate with patience, kindness, and understanding. It also reminds us that love should be the foundation of all our interactions with others. Overall, the goal of Christian communication should be to build relationships and foster understanding and mutual respect between people.
