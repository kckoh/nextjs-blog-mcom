## Non-verbal codes for men and women in a business setting

Nonverbal communication is a type of communication that occurs without the use of words. It includes body language, gestures, facial expressions, and other visual and physical communication forms. Nonverbal communication can be different between men and women and between different cultures. Some common nonverbal cues that may differ between men and women include eye contact, facial expressions, and body posture.

In business, men may use nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, to convey **confidence**, **authority**, and **professionalism**. Some common nonverbal cues that men may use in a business setting include maintaining good eye contact, standing up straight with their shoulders back, and using hand gestures to emphasize points. Additionally, men may use facial expressions to show interest or engagement in a conversation, such as nodding their heads. It's important to remember that nonverbal communication can vary between individuals and cultures, so it's always best to pay attention to the specific context and cues being used.

In business, women are better at perceiving nonverbal cues than men. According to Harvard University psychologist Robert Rosenthal, research reveals that women were superior in decoding body movement, facial expressions and voice quality than men (Audrey, 2022). This may be related too their gender role when they were taught to give care and nurture.

### Different cultures have different communication styles

Each culture has a different way of communicating. In other words, communication between men and women might be very diverse from culture to culture. AFS state that western cultures have direct communication styles while indirect communication is used by eastern cultures (AFS, n.d.).   Moreover, in countries with a high percentage of masculinity, communication will be conducted respecting men, while in some countries with a high feminist, language that respects women will be used. In the workplace, communication between different genders can become commonplace when these factors are combined. 

## Identity **and Intercultural Communication**

Identity looks at who people are, as well as who other people think they are.  Identity can be formed through the self, through communication with others, and through social or historical forces (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 161).  Impression management theory is the ways in which people attempt to control the impressions that other people have about them (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 159).  It is possible that this theory is used by many people within business settings.  For example, a highly caring and empathetic woman may control those characteristics at work in order to come across as more professional or direct, so that she does not give her co-workers the impression that she is weak.  Ascription is the process in which others attribute identities to an individual (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 164).  This is likely to occur within workplaces and it could involve attributing positive or negative identities to an individual.  Going back to my example of the highly caring and empathetic woman, some co-workers may attribute these characteristics as being beneficial for collaborating, whereas other may attribute these characteristics as being too easy-going or indecisive for collaborating.  Both of these positive and negative ascriptions can contribute to an individuals identity, as well as inform ones view about where they fit in within the workplace.  

Gender identity refers to the identification with the cultural notion of masculinity and femininity and what it means to be a man or woman (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 175).  Communication style plays an important role within gender identity.  Women usually have a communication style that is supportive, personal, and egalitarian, whereas men’s communication style is usually competitive and assertive (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 176).  After reading these two different communication styles between the genders it may be evident why men are more likely to receive roles of leadership within a business.  It is important that we do not accept these communication styles as hard truth, as there are many stereotypes around both genders communication styles.  These stereotypes are not always true and therefore we should not assume that every women’s communication style is supportive or that every man’s communication style is competitive.  

## **Culture, Communication, and Conflict**

Conflict is likely to occur at some point in business settings because people are coming together with different values, ideas, perspectives, and communication styles.  Conflict can be defined as the interference between two or more individuals or groups of people who perceive incompatible goals, values, or expectations (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 418).  In a workplace, conflict is bound to happen which is why it is important to be aware about the different communication styles between men and women, as this awareness could help less conflicts to occur.  When it comes to approaching conflict, there is the direct and the indirect approach.  The direct approach uses precise and specific language to deal with conflict whereas the indirect approach uses vague and nonspecific language to deal with conflict (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 425).  In regards to gender communication styles, men are more likely to use the direct approach to conflict and women are more likely to use the indirect approach to conflict.  

If a conflict arises within the workplace, it is important to be aware about what type of conflict approach style people tend to use, as this could help conflicts to be resolved more quickly than if you are not aware about why someone is trying to deal with conflict in a certain way.  There is also the emotionally expressive approach and the restraint approach when it comes to dealing with conflict.  The emotionally expressive approach deals with conflict by overt displays of feeling, while the restraint approach deals with conflict by hiding or suppressing feelings (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 426).  Women are more likely to use the emotionally expressive approach and men are more likely to use the restraint approach, but again, it is important to remember that this is not the hard truth as either gender could use either approach.  Dialogue is conversations that are slow, careful, involve feelings, respectful, and attentive (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 438).  Dialogue can be a beneficial tool to use when trying to work through conflict.  Awareness, dialogue, and forgiveness are a few important aspects of dealing with conflict in a beneficial way.  Conflict is bound to happen within a workplace, especially if a workplace is diverse, so it is important for individuals to know how to deal with conflict effectively as it can help the workplace to remain a respectful and peaceful place.
