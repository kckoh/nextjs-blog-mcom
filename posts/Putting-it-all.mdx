# What have we learned through this project?

## Heewon

I am a business major and I am also interested whenever I deal with the business topic. Moreover, my dream is to start my own company and I want to give better benefits so that my employees can enjoy working. The reason I have this dream is that when I was 18, I heard that many Korean people feel stressed while working so I do not want them to feel pressure. I also learn about how employees can work in a good environment through different classes. For this reason, I was very excited to do this project. 

Gender is always a major issue in Korea. South Korea has had a strong preference for boys for a long time ago. This is why most men held power and women were in the role of supporting men. Moreover, women were unable to return to work or experienced difficulty getting promoted after giving birth, whereas men were easily promoted. As Korea strives to create an equal society for men and women, many of these problems have been resolved. Even if there are still many conflicts caused by gender, I learned through this project that the most important thing among these issues is communication.

I learned that communication between employees is the key to resolving gender-based issues. Communication is needed in order to understand each other about the unfair treatment they have received based on their gender. A compromise must be found through regular communication.

This project also gave me a valuable lesson. I also realize that learning different communication styles is important because it helps me to show respect toward other employees. Conflicts may arise due to different conversation styles, but I think that every employee should try to make successful results by using this as an advantage. 

I will continue to learn by exposing myself to these problems when working for other companies before becoming the boss. Also, if I become the boss and start a company, I will try to create an efficient workplace for my employees by following realistic advice of them and making them enjoy communicating with other genders.

Gender communication is experienced in many different aspects of life, from having conversations with a friend to working together on a project in a business setting.  Throughout my life I have witnessed men receiving roles in leadership more often than woman, whether that be in a church or at a job.  This can be frustrating for women, especially if one has more credentials or experience for a certain role than a man does and yet the man still receives the role.  It is a stereotype that men are better leaders than women and this stereotype is based on the gender communication styles.  Men are perceived as being better leaders because of their assertiveness, directness, and ability to show their power within communication.  It is important to remember that this is a stereotype and breaking stereotypes could help more women receive leadership roles.  Women can also be direct, assertive, and have the ability to lead others well.  

This project taught me how important communication is within the workplace.  I learned that on average there are male and female communication styles and approaches to resolving conflict, but I also learned that stereotypes need to be broken in this area because they are impacting the roles that people may be receiving in the workplace.  Awareness of ones self and the people that they are working with is an important aspect of having effective communication.  Awareness can help employees to both communicate and resolve conflicts effectively.  I learned that diversity is very important within a workplace and that having similarities and differences among employees is a key part of having a successful business.  It is important for workplaces to be inclusive and to let employees have an equal chance and receiving certain roles, despite what gender they are.  

## Kyung Cheol

 i realize how much i lack the understanding of gender communication. Through the process, i recognize the need to understand  gender communication. Gender communication is about how men and women communicate with each other, and how they perceive and understand these communications. As i dive into the concept of gender communication, i realize that there are differences in communication styles, language use, and nonverbal cues that are associated with gender. 

These differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can harm relationships, compromise teamwork, and prevent the successful resolution of conflicts. By understanding and being aware of these differences, both men and women can communicate more effectively and avoid misunderstandings, which are keys to success in the workplace. This can improve relationships, enhance teamwork, and help achieve goals. As a computer science major, the communication plays a big role in advancing the career. Many would prefer to work with people whom are easy to talk to and communicate. These traits do not come easily but with practice and learning and i believe that the first step is to understand and research about the gender communication.

# A dialectical approach to gender communication

Gender communication is a necessary part of everyday life. It helps us to understand each other better and create meaningful relationships. However, it can be difficult to communicate effectively with people from different cultures and background. A dialectical approach to intercultural communication focuses on understanding the underlying complexity of conversations between people from different backgrounds and creating mutual understanding in order to bridge gaps.

This approach involves examining both sides of an argument and recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to cultural differences. Instead, this method encourages open dialogue between two parties, allowing them to recognize their differences and work towards finding common ground. The dialectical approach also encourages problem-solving that considers all perspectives involved in the conversation instead of imposing a single worldview or solution on the participants.

## Privilege–Disadvantage Dialectic

The textbook mentions that power is one of the significant elements that highly impact the working environment. (Martin & Nakayama, 2018). Furthermore, Martin and Nakayama explain how privileges and disadvantages of dialectic work, “people may be simultaneously privileged and disadvantaged, or privileged in some contexts and disadvantaged in others” (Martin & Nakayama, 2018). People are given positions depending on their power. In companies where men are in high positions, female employees are unable to express their opinions freely and communicate effectively, and they may also feel that they are being treated unfairly compared to their male employees. Conversely, in organizations where women are in high positions, men may feel that they are treated unfairly compared to women and that women enjoy better welfare. Power must be used justly. Especially, bosses should use their power to ensure all their employees feel that communicating with a different gender is valuable. In addition, the boss should also interview all employees to ensure they are treated fairly.

 

## **Differences - Similarities Dialectic**

The similarity principle describes how people tend to be attracted to other people who seem to be similar to themselves (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 384).  Not only are people attracted to those who are similar to themselves, but people also tend to work through disagreements and conflicts in an easier way when they are similar to another person (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 384).  The similarity principle could suggest that it may be easier for a manager to hire people for their business who are similar to themselves.  Although it may be easier to do this, this would not promote a diverse workplace and the business would likely not be as successful as it could be.  Research shows that the most successful relationships have a balance in differences and similarities (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 384).  This would also be true in a business setting, as a workplace would be more successful when it has a balance of differences and similarities amongst the employees.  This could be similarities or differences in gender, race, or age, as diversity within a workplace can bring in new perspectives that could make it more successful.  Males and females both bring in their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to communicating in the workplace.  They have their similarities and their differences, which is a good thing because that is how new ideas are brought into the workplace.  A business where everyone is the same would not be successful. 

## Personal-Context Dialect

The personal-context dialect suggests “intercultural communications are personal and contextual” (Martin & Nakayama, 2022, p. 383). In light of gender communication, Intercultural communications are personal because we have preferences over certain gender. Intercultural communications are contextual because contexts change the norms of the personal. For instance, Kyle is a junior developer who prefers to speak to males because he is mostly surrounded by male coworkers. However, a new female intern has joined the team, and the manager puts her in charge. As a personal preference, he may be uncomfortable to communicate with her, but the context has forced him to communicate with his new intern.
