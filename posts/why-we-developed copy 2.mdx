In the business world, gender communication can vary significantly between men and women. Communication in a business setting is essential for success and having an understanding of the differences in communication can help individuals better navigate the workplace. Gender communication styles are often due to years of social conditioning that have resulted in different expectations, needs, and values among genders. We developed this resource because It is important to be aware of these differences in order to bridge any potential communication gaps that may exist between men and women in a business setting.

## Self-Awareness Imperative

According to pumble, statistics show that 86% of employees cite the lack of communication as the main causes for workplace failures. To avoid such failures, effective communication must be deployed (*Workplace communication statistics*, 2022). The first step is to be self-aware of different communication styles. 

Did you know that males and females resolve conflicts in different ways in general? For instance, females tend to use empathy and emotional intelligence to defuse the situation and find a resolution. This can involve trying to understand the other person's feelings and emotions, and using this understanding to find a solution that addresses both parties' needs. On the other hands, males tend to engage in direct communication and compromise and negotiation to find a solution that works for both parties. This can involve each party making concessions in order to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome.

Therefore, we need to be self-aware of these different styles of communication and have empathy toward each other.

## **Peace Imperative**

It is not easy to find peace in our society these days because other social issues constantly arise. For that reason, gender issues make it difficult to find peace in communication among employees. However, the textbook highlights that facilitated dialogue is important to achieve peace in communication (Martin & Nakayama, 2018). Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) defines facilitated dialogue that facilitators help individuals to reduce conflicts and teach them effective communication methods (OSCR, n.d.). A workplace is a place where people coexist. They also have the responsibility to work together to achieve good results. That is why communication plays the most important role. As the gender issue is an unavoidable problem in our society, it is a problem that can also often occur in the organization while communicating with different genders. This might cause more serious conflict between female and male employees. Employees cannot find peace perfectly in the workplace, but by implementing facilitated dialogue, employees will be encouraged to reduce stress and enjoy communication peacefully. Facilitators must help build peace among their employees.


## **Demographic Imperative**

Demographics are the characteristics of a population, such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, and income (Martin & Nakayama, 2018).  When observing a business setting, it is likely that the demographic of the workplace is evident.  The world is very diverse and therefore workplaces should also be very diverse.  Martin and Nakayama (2018) mention that diversity within a team can improve overall performance.  Diversity can help bring different perspectives and ideas into a workplace, therefore having a diverse range of employees could benefit the overall performance of the business.  In regards to the issue about the effects of gender communication in the workplace, the demographic imperative shows how diversity is important and how both genders working together can improve the overall workplace.  This resource is useful because managing diversity within workplaces is a significant and sometimes difficult task for managers or organizations (Jung & Welch, 2022).  Organizations that practice diversity and are inclusive empower their employees, as their workers believe that they are important members of the business (Jung & Welch, 2022).  Taking into account the differences in communication styles between males and females could help empower employees, making them feel valued and heard within the workplace.  When people feel like their comments have been heard, they are more likely to continue sharing their thoughts and new ideas.  When a diverse workplace values everyones opinions and people can put aside their differences, working together in a collaborative manner, the workplace will flourish.
